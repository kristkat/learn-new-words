# learn-new-words
## Motivation

While reading an article in foreign language I often meet new words. Not knowing them doesnt ruin the understanding of the idea of an article, but it is interesting to know what these words mean. I usualy write them down on some stickers but do often forget to look there anyway. Thats why i decided to make a mobile/destop app which will help me to save new words and then review them in my phone/laptop. There are already some apps which can do that but i want to explore some new technologies and make this app in my own design and with functionality that i need.

## Functionality
Following features the app should have:
+ the database with words
+ possibility to add new word in to the database
+ either the user write the translation himself or usage of extern dictionary e.g Pons API is used(free quota of 1000 reference queries per month)
+ learning mode, where user get random words and need either write translation down in the app or just think about it and the get the translation by e.g clicking on the word
+ saved words are split by language
